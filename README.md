ECON5094 Detailed Reading List
Part 2 - Tanya Wilson
The course companion texts are
• “Mostly Harmless Econometrics” by J. Angrist and J.S. Pischke, Princeton Uni-versity Press (noted in reading list as MHE)
• Blundell, R.,  Dias, M. C. (2009). Alternative approaches to evaluation in em-pirical microeconomics. Journal of Human Resources, 44(3), 565-640. (noted in reading list as BCD)
I would advise all students intending to conduct empirical analysis in their PhD thesis to read these texts in their entirety. Relevant chapters/article sections corresponding to each week’s lectures are indicated.
For leisure reading:
• The Economist as Detective by Claudia Goldin - link to paper
• The Economist as Plumber by Esther Duflo - link to paper
• “Freakonomics” by Steve Levitt and Stephen Dubner
For each unit I have included key papers on the econometric methods used, references for the papers discussed in the lectures and additional papers which use the method described in the relevant lecture. * indicates required reading. Everything else is op-tional. Those papers in bold font have supplementary data files available - usually on the respective journal’s website.
